# CatDex
CatDex allows a user to keep track of all his or her cats (index). The user can also add, edit cat, and delete a cat.

Technologies used to create CatDex are: React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, HTML, and CSS/Bootstrap.

Add a new Cat (Name, Breed, Description, or anything else you think would be important)
Remove Cats
Edit Cats
List all of his Cats
Use Redux for state management and utilize frontend actions
